            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        </header>

        <main class="tos-content">
            <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
            <p><strong>1.1</strong> By starting a commission with me, you agree to these terms. Please read everything before we begin to make sure we're on the same page.</p>
            <p><strong>1.2</strong> If these terms are not followed, I might need to cancel the project, and no refunds will be issued.</p>
            <p><strong>1.3</strong> By moving forward with a project, you confirm that you've accepted these terms. If you have any concerns, let's discuss them before starting the work.</p>

            <h2>2. Payment</h2>
            <p><strong>2.1</strong> Payments can be made via PayPal or Robux. PayPal payments come with a 10% processing fee, and Robux payments should account for platform fees to ensure I   receive the full amount.</p>
            <p><strong>2.2</strong> For projects valued below $50 USD (or R$20,000), full payment is required upfront. For projects valued at $50 USD or more (or R$20,000 and above), a 50% deposit is required upfront. The remaining 50% is due within 12 hours of project completion. If the balance is not paid within this timeframe, a 10% late fee will be added to the total. If payment is still not received after 24 hours, the matter will be reported to relevant third parties.</p>
            <p><strong>2.3</strong> Refunds aren't offered unless there's a clear issue from my side. I will do my best to resolve any problems fairly if they arise.</p>
            <p><strong>2.4</strong> Prices are listed in USD (for PayPal) or Robux (for Roblox). Any additional taxes or fees are your responsibility, depending on the payment method you  choose.</p>
            <p><strong>2.5</strong> PayPal payments must be sent using the 'Friends and Family' option. If payment is sent incorrectly, you have 24 hours to request a refund. After this time,     payments are final.</p>
            <p><strong>2.6</strong> I don't accept revenue-sharing deals unless the game has more than 200 concurrent players and the percentage offered is 5% or higher.</p>

            <h2>3. Revisions</h2>
            <p><strong>3.1</strong> Minor changes are included, but if major revisions are needed, we can discuss additional charges. It's best to finalize details upfront to avoid extra  costs later.</p>
            <p><strong>3.2</strong> I'll fix any bugs for free within 48 hours after the delivery. After that, any fixes will come with additional charges.</p>

            <h2>4. Confidentiality</h2>
            <p><strong>4.1</strong> I have full permission to showcase the work I've done for you in my portfolio, on my website, and on social media. I will not share source code or sensitive information.</p>
            <p><strong>4.2</strong> If you write a review, your username, profile picture, and the project's price will be displayed on my portfolio website. By submitting a review, you agree that I can display this information.</p>
            <p><strong>4.3</strong> Any private information shared with me will stay confidential. Your data and ideas are safe with me.</p>
            <p><strong>4.4</strong> I do not sign NDAs or other agreements of that nature.</p>

            <h2>5. Termination</h2>
            <p><strong>5.1</strong> If you cancel a commission, I will keep the 50% upfront payment, and you will be reported to the third parties.</p>
            <p><strong>5.2</strong> If I cancel the project, I will offer a full refund. You are not allowed to report, use any third-party methods or take further action against me after claiming a refund.</p>
        </main>

        <div class="tos-acceptance">
            <p>By continuing to use my services, you accept that you have read through and agree to the terms in this document. If you have any doubts or queries, please do let me know so I can clear your confusion.</p>
